The sources obtained by reverse engineering are published in another fork for informational purposes, a complete compilation of the application from them is artificially made to impossible. However, despite this, the application can be assembled in a special way.

All compiled libraries are included in the source code, including well-known ones, since the original application was built on currently outdated APIs, JDK and SDK/NDK and was not refitted, in addition, the sources contain multiple intersections with these libraries and vice versa.

The goal of this project is  update exist application for actual Android versions.
